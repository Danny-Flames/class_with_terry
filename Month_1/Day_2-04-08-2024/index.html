        <h2>
            git clone url
        </h2>
        <p>
            This command clones(downloads) an online(a remote) repository into your local machine(laptop)
        </p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h2>
            git pull 
        </h2>
        <p>
            This command pulls the latest changes from the remote repository to your local repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that whenever you use this command, it pulls directly from the local branch you're in at that point.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to pull from another branch, you'll use the command below: <br />
            <b>
                git pull origin branch_name
            </b>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>
            git push
        </h2>
        <p>
            This command push your latest changes to the remote(online) repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the local branch you're working on does not exist already at the remote repository, you'd have to use the command below: <br />
            <b>git push -u origin branch_names</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            What the command above does is to set/create a remote copy of that local branch on the remote(online) repo.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>
            git checkout -b 'branch_name'
        </h2>
        <p>
            What this command does is to checkout(create) to a branch.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the branch already exists in your local repo, use the command below: <br />
            <b>git checkout 'branch_name'</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that the -b flag should be added when you're creating a new branch else do not include it.
